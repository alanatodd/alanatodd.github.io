    <h2 id="about_me"> About Me </h2>
     <p> My name is Alana Todd. I am currently in my third year at the City College of New York.
    I aspire to work in the animation field as an animator or visual development artist.
    I enjoy being creative; I crochet, bake and decorate cakes, as well as design my own clothing. I aspire to work in collaboration with other people to bring an idea into reality.
    My eagerness for learning knows no bounds and I am quick to adapt to any situation.
