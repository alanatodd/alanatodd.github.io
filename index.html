    I aspire to work in the animation field as an animator or visual development artist.
    I enjoy being creative; I crochet, bake and decorate cakes, as well as design my own clothing. I aspire to work in collaboration with other people to bring an idea into reality.
    My eagerness for learning knows no bounds and I am quick to adapt to any situation.
